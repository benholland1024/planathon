      <h1>About</h1>
      <p>We're a team of Kent State students with experience planning hackathons - so we know exactly how hard it can be. We built this tool to help other organizers learn the tricks and tips we've picked up over the years. </p>

      <p>Planathon wasn't just based off of our experiences, though. We interviewed a wide range of hackathon organizers across the country, to provide the best range of organization suggestions possible. </p>

      <p>If you're unfamiliar with the concept of a hackathon, you can learn more <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackathon" target="_blank">here</a>. </p>

      <p>The Planathon team is Lauren Greathouse, Alex Gajowski, Timothy Park, Gabe Abdullah, and Ben Holland.</p>

      <p>Thanks for stopping by!</p>
